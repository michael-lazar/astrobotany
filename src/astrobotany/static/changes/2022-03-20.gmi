## Changes

* Introducing badge series two! 100 new emoji badges to collect & trade.
* Visiting a plant will now display a message if it's owner has not watered it for over 5 days. Historical data was not collected, so the clock will reset to 0 for all plants starting now.
* There's a new "garden fence" item in the store than can be used to restrict others from watering your plant for you.
* Fixed dead plants possibly showing up when filtering by "flowering".
